Read (and hopefully soon write) WinView/WinSpec SPE files using Common Lisp.

CL-SPE defines the package cl-spe that contains functions to read data from
WinView/WinSpec SPE files into Common Lisp arrays.

Exported functions:

* read-spe-frames file &key frame-numbers
Return a list of CL-ARRAYs that contain the frames from FILE. FRAME-NUMBERS
can be NIL or :all to read all frames, or a list of numbers of the desired
frames. Frame counting starts at 0.

* read-spe-frames* stream &key frame-numbers header
Same as read-spe-frames, but works on an octet stream. If the header was
previously read using read-spe-header or read-spe-header*, it can be provided
to prevent another read of the header.

* read-spe-frame file &key frame-number
Return a CL-ARRAY of the first frame in FILE. FRAME-NUMBER can be set to
a number to specify the desired frame number.

* read-spe-frame* stream &key frame-number header
Same as read-spe-frame, but works on an octet stream. If the header was
previously read using read-spe-header or read-spe-header*, it can be provided
to prevent another read of the header.

* read-spe-header file &optional fields
Read the header of FILE into a PLIST. When FIELDS is nil, :minimal or
:mandatory, a minimal set of fields is read, enough to know how to interpret
a frame. If FIELDS is :all, all the fields in the header will be read.
Alternatively, FIELDS can be a LIST of the desired field names.

* read-spe-header stream &optional fields
Same as read-spe-header, but works on an octet stream.

Not all header fields are currently known to cl-spe. Here is a list of the
ones that are defined. The minimal fields are:

:x-dimension
:y-dimension
:data-type
:number-of-frames

Other fields are:
:date
:roi
:number-of-roi

Others can be added easily, but weren't because I am too lazy.
